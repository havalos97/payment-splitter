## MOTIVATION
When me and my friends meet, there are times where some people buy stuff and the rest of them have to pay. We always find out who owes who but this app should make it easier.

## HOW TO USE THIS APP
1. In the main page you have to fill the name of the every person and the initial amount they already paid.
2. Once all the people is in the list, make sure the total is correct and click the button "Calculate".
3. It will show a list of debtors, basically who owes who.
4. If you want to add more people to the list, click the button "Go back".
5. If you want to wipe all the data, click the button "Clear all" and click "Yes" in the prompt.
6. In case you want to share the list with friends, click the "Share" button, next to the button to add people to the list (Green Plus Icon). Please note that any future change made by you or the other person will be out of sync. In case you want to send the most up-to-date data, click the "Share" button again.
